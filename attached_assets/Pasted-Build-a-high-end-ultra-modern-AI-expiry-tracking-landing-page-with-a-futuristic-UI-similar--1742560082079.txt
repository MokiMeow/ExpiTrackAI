Build a **high-end, ultra-modern AI expiry tracking landing page** with a **futuristic UI** similar to **Huly.io & Hatom.com**. It should feel smooth, visually stunning, and highly interactive with **Framer Motion, Three.js, and optimized animations** for ultra-fast rendering.

### **ðŸ”¹ Fixes & Improvements Needed**
1. **Hero Section Fixes:**
   - The text **"Stop Wasting. Start Tracking."** is too big and touching the navbar. Adjust spacing, **reduce font size**, and ensure perfect responsiveness.
   - Ensure the **CTA buttons (Get Started Free & Watch Demo)** have a **smooth hover glow effect** and scale slightly on hover.
   - **Add a subtle particle animation** in the background for a futuristic AI look.
   - **Hero image interaction:** Implement a **Three.js floating effect** for the mockups.

2. **Dark Mode / Light Mode Issues:**
   - Ensure the **toggle actually works** properly with smooth transitions.
   - Background and text colors should shift fluidly using **Framer Motion**.
   - Add a **small sun/moon rotation animation** on the dark mode toggle.

3. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - **Improve render speed** by optimizing animations with **Framer Motion**.
   - Ensure all elements **lazy-load** efficiently without layout shifts.
   - Use **GPU acceleration for animations** to keep them ultra-smooth.
   - Preload important assets to avoid flickering when switching themes.

4. **Section Spacing & Design Issues:**
   - The **"How It Works" section** is too dark. Increase contrast, add **a neon glow effect** to make steps **pop**.
   - The **"Smart Home Management" text is faded out and unreadable**. Improve contrast & add a **hover effect** to reveal hidden content.
   - Fix alignment issues in **testimonials & benefits sections** by ensuring proper grid spacing.

5. **Better Animations & Interactivity:**
   - **Use Framer Motion for smooth scroll effects** (parallax on hero, staggered reveal for sections).
   - Implement **Three.js for interactive 3D elements** (hover-based movement on the hero mockup).
   - Add **a slight scroll-based depth effect** for cards & UI components.
   - Ensure buttons have **micro-interactions** that respond to cursor movement.
   - Improve **testimonial carousel smoothness** for a more premium feel.
